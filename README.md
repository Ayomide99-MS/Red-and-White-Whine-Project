- **Wine Types:** Red and White
- **Target Variable:** `Quality` (Rated from 0 to 10)

### Main Features:
- `Fixed Acidity`
- `Volatile Acidity`
- `Citric Acid`
- `Residual Sugar`
- `Chlorides`
- `Free Sulfur Dioxide`
- `Total Sulfur Dioxide`
- `Density`
- `pH`
- `Sulphates`
- `Alcohol`
- `Quality`

## 📌 Dashboard Highlights

1. **Wine Type Distribution**  
   - Majority of the wines are **White Wine**.
   - Pie charts provide a visual comparison of red vs white wine sample counts and ratings.

2. **Key Influencing Factors**
   - Top 3 factors impacting quality:
     - **Alcohol**
     - **Volatile Acidity**
     - **Sulphates**

3. **Quality vs Chemical Properties**
   - **Higher alcohol** generally correlates with **higher quality**.
   - **Volatile acidity** negatively affects quality.
   - Ideal **pH** and **citric acid** ranges enhance taste and rating.

4. **Comparative Averages by Quality Score**
   - Bar charts show how chemical metrics like alcohol, acidity, and sugar vary with wine quality scores (3–8).
   - White wines typically show higher sulfur and sugar content than red wines.

---

## 📈 Recommendations

- Improve or maintain **alcohol level**, **sulphates**, and **volatile acidity** for better wine quality.
- Keep **pH levels** in the ideal range (3.0 – 3.4).
- Use chemical profiling to predict or enhance wine scoring.

## ⚙️ Data Processing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, duplicates, and outliers.
2. **Pivot Table Analysis** – Used for aggregating key comparisons across quality ratings.
3. **Dashboard Development** – Created in Power BI with visual storytelling and insights.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project gives a clear picture of how certain chemical properties affect wine quality. Alcohol and acidity management are key to producing high-rated wines. The dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for winemakers and data analysts in the food and beverage industry.
